A customizable userstyle for WhatsApp. Some of the features include:

* Whole UI is styled to match the overall theme
* Customizable colors, wide variety of light and dark color-schemes supported
* Compact mode for small resolutions since there is no official support for it yet
* Fullscreen mode, if you prefer using the app without wasted space
* Private mode where contact list and/or images are blurred until you hover over them
* Light/dark/no chat area doodles
* Enable/disable message tails
* Custom background images
* Custom emoji opacity
* Custom compact mode breakpoint and ability to disable it
* Custom CSS so you can overwrite mine and not worry about future updates
