* Getting Involved

There are a number of ways to get involved with the development of this Dark
WhatsApp theme. Even if you've never contributed to an Open Source project
before, we're always looking for help identifying missing styles or other
issues.

* How to Report Style Issues

** I don't know CSS

If you don't know CSS very well and have found a missing style, please include
as much as possible of following information when opening an issue:

- Screenshot of the problem
- Include the element(s) in the console if at all possible
  - To select an element, target it with your mouse then right-click and choose
    "Inspect Element"
  - Copy the HTML if at all possible

** I know both CSS & GitHub

- Follow the [[#style-guide][style guide]] below
- Make any needed changes, then send us a pull request
- Please include a URL to the page (if public)

*** Style Guide

- Limit to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#Variant:_BSD_KNF][K&R (KNF variation style)]], and *TAB SPACE INDENTATION* (not more,
  and not less than 4 spaces).
  - Use [[https://editorconfig.org/][EditorConfig]] plugin for your editor if at all possible, and let it take
    care of indentation.

- K&R - KNF Variation Example:
  #+BEGIN_SRC css
  element[attr='value'] {
  ····property: value;
  }
  #+END_SRC

- *Not* Allman
  #+BEGIN_SRC css
  element[property='value']
  {
  ····property: value;
  }
  #+END_SRC

- Strict space between the =selector= and the ={=:
  #+BEGIN_SRC css
    /* good */
    element[attr='value'] { }
    /* bad */
    element[attr='value']{ }
  #+END_SRC

- Don't go multi-line for simple one-liners
  #+BEGIN_SRC css
  /* good */
  element { property: value }
  /* bad */
  element {
      property: value;
  }
  #+END_SRC

- 4 [Tab] Space indentation
  #+BEGIN_SRC css
  /* good */
  ····property: value;
  /* bad */
  ··property: value;
  --property: value;
  ·property: value;
  #+END_SRC

- Use the provided mixins and variables

  You can find more about them at the top of the =wa.user.styl= file. Also, use
  [[http://stylus-lang.com/][stylus-lang documentation]] to get familar with stylus-lang syntax and features.

  #+BEGIN_SRC css
  /* good */
  element { c: #eee 0 #333 }
  /* best */
  element { c: fg 0 bg }
  /* bad */
  element {
    color: #eee,
    background-color: #333;
  }
  #+END_SRC

- Try to wrap lines at around 80 characters.
- This style does not have a size limit, but:
  - If possible, reduce any added selectors. Remember that the style likely has
    an =!important= flag to override default styling, so a selector starting
    from the body isn't always necessary.
  - If your CSS definition already exists within the style, do not add it again!
    Add your selector to the existing definition.
- Insert any new CSS selectors in any available slot before the style
  definition, or on a new line as needed.
- If you want to add a new userstyle variable, please open an issue and discuss
  it with us first.
- Don't include version bumps with your contribution, all releases are handled
  internally.
- If your pull request (PR) fixes an open issue or replaces another PR, include
  fixes/closes =#issue-number= in your commit message title. [[https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords][Read more on this.]]
